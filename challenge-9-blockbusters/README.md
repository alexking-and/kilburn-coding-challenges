# Challenge 9 - Blockbusters

## Problem
Your task for this challenge is to create a working implementation of Tetris. 
You can tackle this challenge in whichever format, language, framework or engine you choose and the winner will be judged on a range of criteria including:
* Quality of code
* Quality of game play
* Any features which go above and beyond the basic expectations

## Solution
As a huge Tetris fan who was about to start playing around with game development anyway: BEST. CHALLENGE. EVER.

I have some big ideas of what to do, but I've never made a game before and haven't touched Unity or VR dev since playing around with it 6 years ago when the whole ecosystem was way more primitive; so, I'm going to work in iterations to make sure I have at least something done by the deadline:
1. Have a basic form of Tetris playable from a fixed location in VR.
2. Add locomotion (ability to move around space).
3. Make the board GINORMOUS and add crushing sound effects because I just like the idea of massive Tetris.
4. Control the pieces by physically dragging rather than by sticks & buttons.
